This resource is not intended to be used on its own and you sould tweak the script to fit your needs!  
This scoreboard only uses [DrawRect](https://docs.fivem.net/natives/?_0x3A618A217E5154F0) and Text natives.
The scoreboard can only show 16 players properly, because it seems that GTA V can only draw 144 (I guess) Text's at the same frame.  
The code can be easily optimized, but then, each portion of the code wouldn't be so redeable.

How to install it
-
1. Download the resource.
2. Drop the folder called `antalme_gtav_scoreboard` into your resource folder.
3. Add `ensure antalme_gtav_scoreboard` to your `.cfg`.
4. Finally, start the server and you will see the scoreboard working without doing anything else.

Testing
-
- Use **Up Arrow** to add a new row populated with random player data to the scoreboard.
- Use **Down Arrow** to remove the last row from the scoreboard.
